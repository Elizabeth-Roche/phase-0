#Release 1 - Summarize#
What does puts do?
The puts command writes whatever comes after it to the console with a new line.
What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number like 1,2 or 3. A float is a number with a decimal like 1.5.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division will give you the exact number of times one number goes into another with a decimal (eg: 9/2=4.5) where as integer division shows you how many times a whole number can go into another number evenly without leaving a decimal remainder(eg: 9/2=4). Let's say you make a tray of 9 cookies and you want to separate the cookies into two even cookie tins to give to your friends. If you were to use float division, you would put 4.5 cookies in each tin. But these tins are supposed to be gifts and no one really likes a half cookie. So you'd opt to use integer division and put 4 cookies in each tin. You'd then eat the bonus cookie whilst fist pumping into the night's sky.

#Reflection Release 7#
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers? Ruby handles addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication(*) and division (/) using either integers or floats.
What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a whole number whereas a float as a decimal.
What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division let's us know how many times a whole number goes into another number. Float division gives us how many times a number goes into anoter number and includes a decimal remainder.
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
A String is a group of letters in a program. You would use a string when the input and or output is a word or sentence!
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A local variable starts with a lowercase letter or an underscore. You can use local variable to give variables values in a specific instance or in a certain context. The local variables can change along the way and do not apply globally.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was a great refresher and a nice way to combine some of the things we've learned so far!
