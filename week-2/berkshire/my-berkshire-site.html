- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was interesting and gratifying to run the HTML in jsfiddle. I was easily able to translate my previous learning by simply looking at the sample website and then mentally going through the steps to mimick it.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I mainly used Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS guide and found it to be rather helpful along with the code academy stuff. I was able to look up whatever I needed with those items. Once or twice, I went into google to verify something.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We really focused on getting the proper content on the site in the proper order and worried less about formatting. If a formatting question came up, we would talk it through to determine whether it was a formatting question or HTML question.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems to be fairly simple for a new user to understand and I felt like getting the hang of it was quick. HTML is limiting in what you can do and it seems like HTML produces very basic looking webpages.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I've beeing adding the closing tags when I open up a tag in order to remember that I need to close it. Other than that, I haven't come up with any magic tricks to remember syntax other that creating a cheat sheet to reference and repetition.
