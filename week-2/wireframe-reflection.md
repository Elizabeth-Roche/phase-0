#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a 2-d blueprint of how you want your site or project to work. The wireframe shows the hierarchy of how information on the page will be displayed and consumed by the user.
#What are the benefits of wireframing?
The wireframe allows you to think through how you want your site to operate before you begin coding. The wireframe makes you consider how the user will go through the site and will also help you to prioritize information based on your target audience. It helps you look at the big picture of how you want your site to operate and what you want to include on your site before you get to coding.
#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I enjoyed wireframing my site and feel that the wireframe may change based on my progress.
#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I went through two different ideas before settling on the wireframe submitted.
#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I was wondering what types of wireframing software were available and how to use them. I also wanted to see sample wireframes to get an idea of what other people are doing. I wanted to know how many iterations people usually go through when wireframing. I was able to find some wireframe galleries and also read up more on wireframes on stack overflow. I enjoyed reading some of the comments in the comment section of various wireframe galleries. It gave me a glimpse into how professionals are using wireframes.
#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I attempted to use a free wireframing tool online called mockingbird. I found using this extremely tedious and difficult. After attempting to use it for about 30 minutes, I decided to put my wireframes on pen and paper. Another thing I'm having a lot of trouble with is getting my wireframed images to show up in github. I've tried several different things and can't get it right.
