#take array of everyone in your class
#determine the number of elements in the array
#can we evenly divide the array by 5? if not, can we evenly divide the array by 4? if not, can we evenly divide the array by three? - as soon as one of those is true, break the array down into an array of arrays of the number that evenly divides into the array.
#return the array of arrays.

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# I did not find this challenge too difficult. I thought about what I wanted my output to be and then worked backwards from there in my pseudocode. I knew I wanted to keep things really simple and I wanted to try to implement what I've learned so far.
# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# I'm absolutely improving my pseudocode. I was not very good at pseudocoding when I first began but have been able to get much better at it. I'm finding that it keeps me focused and also keeps my research really focused when I'm working on a challenge.
# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# I think it was a good solution. I think it could have been interesting to make groups of different sizes instead of using a conditional to make all of the groups equal sizes.
# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# I stored it in an array. I thought of using hashes but then I realized that all keys in the hash have to be unique and I wasn't sure of how to do that with the challenge.
# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# I lea each_slice becuase I knew I wanted to iterate over the array and I also knew that I needed to break the array into smaller arrays. I came across each_slice in my initial research and used it.
