# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
1. I learned about time boxing techniques and how to use triggers to build habits. I also learned about the benefits of rest and meditation and how resting your brain can give you new perspective on projects you're working on.

2. Time boxing is setting temporal limits/goals on project as opposed to creating progress goals. Instead of working on a project until completion, time boxing is an agreed upon time period to do work within.

3. I currently try to work on tasks until they are completed and I often times take breaks from work only when items are completed rather than breaking from work when I'm frustrated. This usually leads me to burning out and then procrastinating.

4. This strategy is not working for me because I get frustrated and down on myself if I am struggling with completing a project or task. This increases my stress levels.

5. I'm going to implement time boxing for phase 0. Although I find the pomodoro technique really interesting, I personally think that longer time boxes will work better for me and give me more time to understand and tests concepts. My plan is to try to work in 50 minute blocks and allow myself a 10 minute break. Through some additional research, I was able to find some different ways to relax the mind during breaks. One thing I'm going to try is office yoga during my 10 minute breaks.

6. My plan is to work for 5 hours per day in 50 minute on, 10 minute off blocks. I might do two hours before noon and three hours after 4pm but I want to try to get 5 hours per day accomplished with one day off. In the event that I reach my flow, I will continue working in more blocks on that day. I want to take Sundays off moving forward.
