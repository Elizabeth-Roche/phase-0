#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Go to your GitHub profile and click the plus button in the upper right hand side and select "new repository". Name your repository, select "public", add the MIT license and click the "create repository" button. Now you've created a repository on GitHub and you want to clone it to your own computer so you can work in your terminal and push changes to GitHub. Open up your terminal and make sure you're in the appropriate directory. If you don't know where you are, you can type the pwd command to find out and navigate from there. Next, you want to copy link in the HTTPS box in your repository on GitHub. Navigate back to your terminal and type: git clone and then paste the URL you copied from GitHub and hit enter.

#Describe what open source means.
Open source is when code is shared and anyone can view it and/or customize it for their own needs.
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It's an interesting concept and one that is very new to me as someone with no coding experience. It definitely puts a lot of trust in the hands of open source community but it doesn't make me nervous. Open Source certainly helps out people who are learning and starting out. I can't think of another industry where you have this kind of free flow of ideas and knowledge sharing and I'm into it.
#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licensing is a way to release and share your work without giving up the original copyright or patent. Licensing is important because it promotes open source information sharing but still protects the original creator of the code.
#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I was struggling with branches and this challenge really solidified my understanding of what a branch is, when to create one, how to use it when merging and then how to delete it once it's done. I couldn't figure out how to delete the branch from my terminal for a while and finally figured out how to navigate away from it and then still was running into issues. Then I realized I hadn't merged the pull request in GitHub. Problem solved. I think I have a way better understanding of the workflow at this point.
#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I only used the resources provided.
