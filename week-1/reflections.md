# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
1. I learned about time boxing techniques and how to use triggers to build habits. I also learned about the benefits of rest and meditation and how resting your brain can give you new perspective on projects you're working on.

2. Time boxing is setting temporal limits/goals on project as opposed to creating progress goals. Instead of working on a project until completion, time boxing is an agreed upon time period to do work within.

3. I currently try to work on tasks until they are completed and I often times take breaks from work only when items are completed rather than breaking from work when I'm frustrated. This usually leads me to burning out and then procrastinating.

4. This strategy is not working for me because I get frustrated and down on myself if I am struggling with completing a project or task. This increases my stress levels.

5. I'm going to implement time boxing for phase 0. Although I find the pomodoro technique really interesting, I personally think that longer time boxes will work better for me and give me more time to understand and tests concepts. My plan is to try to work in 50 minute blocks and allow myself a 10 minute break. Through some additional research, I was able to find some different ways to relax the mind during breaks. One thing I'm going to try is office yoga during my 10 minute breaks.

6. My plan is to work for 5 hours per day in 50 minute on, 10 minute off blocks. I might do two hours before noon and three hours after 4pm but I want to try to get 5 hours per day accomplished with one day off. In the event that I reach my flow, I will continue working in more blocks on that day. I want to take Sundays off moving forward.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. A shell is the environment where you can give direct commands to your OS. Bash is command line language that you use to give commands to the OS.

2. This was very challenging material. I was confused when it came time to create a .txt file and then copy it somewhere else. There was not a good explanation of how to do that and I went back through the tutorial only to find that there were no explanations of what we were doing, only instructions on what commands to type into the terminal.

3. Yes, I was able to successfully run all of the commands.

4. pwd is probably the most important command because it is how you can see where you are when you are lost and then of course you can navigate from there. I found myself lost several times and pwd was a lifesaver. mkdir is really important because it's how you make a new directory. grep is important to know because it allows you to find things within files. cd might be the most important because it's how you can change your directory and navigate.

5. pwd - print working directory - shows you where you are right now
ls- list directory - shows you what's in the directory you're in now
mv- move file - how you move files or directories
cd - change directory - navigate to a new directory
../ - brings you backwards on your current path
touch - creates an empty file
mkdir - make a new directory
less - page through the file
rmdir - remove directory
help - get info on commands
rm - remove file and clean up

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
1. Go to your GitHub profile, click the plus sign next to your icon in the upper right hand corner and then select "new repository." On the next page, name your new repo. To fork a repo, click the "fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the repo you'd like. To clone, copy the https link in the forked repo, open up your terminal and go to the directory where you're keeping your phase 0 work. From there, paste the https link into your terminal. You would fork a repository as to not alter an original version that is being used by others.

2. I first didn't have a directory created to keep my phase 0 things and I was trying to follow the instructions exactly as the video presented them. After a few failures, I realized I needed to use what I had learned in command line crash course to create a directory of my own. Once I did that, I was able to save the clone properly. What I learned was to take a step back when things aren't working and look at the process on the whole instead of obsessing over the step I'm stuck on. From there, I was easily able to see what to do...
